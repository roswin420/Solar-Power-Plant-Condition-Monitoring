# 1. Introduction & Key Ideas

This notebook focuses on data analysis, condition monitoring, and fault detection for solar power plants using various techniques including Machine Learing.

## 1.1 Dataset Description

The dataset includes information from two solar power plants in India, collected over 34 days:
- Power generation data (measured at inverters)
- Weather data (measured with a single line of sensors at the plant)

## 1.2 Objectives

1. **Faulty or suboptimal equipment identification**
2. **Panel cleaning/maintenance identification**

# 2. Data & Libraries Import
We will initially examine the data for Plant 1 (both power generation and weather). Plant 2's data can be explored similarly later on. 


## 2.1 Identifying Issues with the dataset using EDA

### 2.1.1 Column Descriptions

**Plant_1_Generation_Data: Column descriptions**
- **DATE_TIME:** Date and time of each observation, recorded at 15-minute intervals.
- **PLANT_ID:** A common identifier for the entire file.
- **SOURCE_KEY:** Represents the inverter ID in this file.
- **DC_POWER:** DC power generated by the inverter (source_key) during each 15-minute interval. Units - kW.
- **AC_POWER:** AC power generated by the inverter (source_key) during each 15-minute interval. Units - kW.
- **TOTAL_YIELD:** Cumulative yield for the inverter up to that point in time.

**Plant_1_Weather_Data: Column descriptions**
- **DATE_TIME:** Date and time of each observation, recorded at 15-minute intervals.
- **PLANT_ID:** A common identifier for the entire file.
- **SOURCE_KEY:** Represents the sensor panel ID, which is the same for the entire file since there's only one sensor panel for the plant.
- **AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE:** Ambient temperature at the plant. *Note: Assumed unit is $°C$ .
- **MODULE_TEMPERATURE:** Temperature reading for the module (solar panel) attached to the sensor panel. *Note: Assumed unit is $°C$ .*
- **IRRADATION:** Irradiation amount for each 15-minute interval. *Note: Assumed unit is $kW/m^2$ .

# 3. Data Exploration & Failure Detection

Now that we have a merged dataset we can take a closer look at data distributions and correlations.

## 3.1 Correlation Analysis

### Key Insights
- High correlation between:
    - DC Power and AC Power
    - Irradiation and DC Power
    - Module Temperature and DC Power
    
- Outlier detected:
    - DC Power v/s AC Power
    - Irradiation v/s DC Power

- Outliers' implications:
    - DC-AC conversion: Inverter malfunction (If there is DC power delivered but less AC power generated than expected the inverter may be malfunctioning.)
    - Power-Irradiation: Panel line failure (If there is enough sunlight but no power is generated, this points to faulty photovoltaic cells.)
